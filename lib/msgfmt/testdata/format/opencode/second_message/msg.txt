     This is the agentapi repository. Based on the codebase structure and documentation, it's a Go HTTP API server that controls various coding agents (like Claude Code, Aider, Goose, etc.) through
     terminal emulation.

     The main purpose of this repository is to:

     - Run coding agents in an in-memory terminal emulator
     - Provide a unified HTTP API to interact with different agent types
     - Parse terminal output into structured messages
     - Include a Next.js web chat UI for interacting with agents
     - Support multiple agent types with different message formats

     The project supports agents like Claude Code, Aider, Goose, Codex, Gemini, and others, providing a standardized interface to communicate with them through HTTP endpoints and a web-based chat
     interface.
