● I'll build a snake game for you. Let me start by reporting my
   progress and creating a task list.


● Now I'll create a complete snake game with HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript:

● Write(snake-game.html)
  ⎿  Wrote 344 lines to snake-game.html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">

         <style>
             * {
                 margin: 0;
                 padding: 0;
     … +334 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



● I've built a complete snake game for you! The game is saved
  at /home/coder/snake-game.html.

  Features:
  - Classic snake gameplay with smooth controls
  - Use arrow keys to control the snake
  - Press SPACE to pause/unpause
  - Score tracking with increasing difficulty (speed increases
  every 5 points)
  - Colorful gradient background and styled UI
  - Game over screen with restart option
  - Snake grows when eating food
  - Collision detection for walls and self-collision

  How to play:
  Open the HTML file in your web browser and use the arrow keys
   to move the snake. Collect the red food to grow and increase
   your score!
