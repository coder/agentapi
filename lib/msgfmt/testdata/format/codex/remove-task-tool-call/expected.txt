• Codex says: I'm starting by reporting the task as working with a
  summary about reviewing the repository structure to gather       
  information for planning the snake game implementation. Next,    
  I'll inspect the repository files.

• I'm drafting a concise final message starting with "Codex says:"
  that briefly explains adding a terminal-based snake game in
  snake.py, highlights key features like controls and scoring,
  notes the need to run with python3 due to missing python alias,
  includes usage instructions, and suggests next steps—all
  formatted as short bullet points with a simple optional header.
