Based on the code snippet you shared, this appears to be from the               
ChatInterface.tsx component in your project. The code shows a React useEffect   
hook that sets up polling for messages and server status.                       
                                                                                
To confirm and make any changes to this file, I'll need you to add it to the    
chat:                                                                           
                                                                                
Please add chat/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx to the chat so I can see the   
full context and make any necessary changes.
