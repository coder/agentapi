 Â» This is the AgentAPI repository by Coder.

   AgentAPI is a tool that provides an HTTP API to control various coding agents including:
     â€¢ Claude Code
     â€¢ Goose
     â€¢ Aider
     â€¢ Gemini CLI
     â€¢ Sourcegraph Amp
     â€¢ Codex
     â€¢ Cursor CLI

   The repository is written in Go (as evidenced by the go.mod file) and includes:
     â€¢ A server component that runs agents in a terminal emulator
     â€¢ A web chat interface (in the /chat directory using Next.js)
     â€¢ HTTP endpoints for sending messages and getting conversation history
     â€¢ Terminal attachment functionality

   The main purpose is to provide a unified interface for controlling different coding agents programmatically, making it easier to build applications that work with multiple AI coding assistants.
