∴ Thinking
  The user is asking me to identify which file contains this specific TypeScript code snippet. The code shows a useEffect hook that sets up polling
for messages and server status. I need to search for this code in the codebase to find the file it belongs to.

  I should use the Grep tool to search for some unique parts of this code to locate the file.

✓ Grep Set up polling for messages and server status

✓ Grep const messageInterval = setInterval\(fetchMessages, 1000\)

✓ List Directory /mnt/c/Users/Username/test-amp

No files found in the workspace containing this code.
