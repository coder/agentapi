┃ How are you?

∴ Thinking
  The user is asking a simple social greeting "How are you?". This is a casual question about my state/wellbeing. I should respond concisely and
directly as per my instructions to keep responses short (fewer than 4 lines unless asked for detail). I don't need to use any tools for this simple
greeting.

  I should avoid elaborate explanations or summaries, and just give a brief, direct response.
